## Yep, Another Hacker Blog!

Welcome!

Here are some things I used/did:
- Responsive "Fork Me" banner [code](https://codepo8.github.io/css-fork-on-github-ribbon/) in CSS.
- Awesome [template](https://github.com/joshgerdes/jekyll-uno). Fork from there, not from here.
- [favicon generator](https://www.favicon-generator.org/).
- Took all the external JS and hosted it internally
- Used [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/how-to-use/on-the-web/setup/getting-started?using=web-fonts-with-css) in place of the foundation icons, due to needing a gitlab icon.
